# 100 Days Of Code with Shri Rachana Rajasekaran
Folow along on a exhilaritng and painful journey of building a habit to learn everyday for the next 100 days. Starting on the 22nd of july. Sitting in a super hot apartment in the peak of summer in 2023. I give in to one of my mangy unfuilfilled dreams of learning and implementing something new everyday. It is easier to be a weekend project girl or the ride the ocassional high on a RaspepberryPi kit home project. 
I have been pining the discipline I had as a teenager trying to get into one of the hardest colleges in South East Asia. Since that last failure, I havent pushed myself to the brink. With a busy work quarter, this would come close if not be as hard and help me learn some in the process. 

The aim to fail , fail quickly but get back to the drawing board every single day without fail. 
Without further ado, I present #100DaysofCode with Shri Rachana.
