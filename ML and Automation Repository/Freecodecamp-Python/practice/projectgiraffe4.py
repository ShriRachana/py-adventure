#Python falls under the category of high-level, interpreted languages. 
# A high-level language is one which cannot be understood directly by our machine. There is a certain degree of abstraction in its syntax. 
# Machines are generally designed to read machine code, but high-level syntax cannot be directly converted to machine code.
#As a result, it must first be converted to bytecode which is then converted to machine code before the program can be executed.
#Python is an interpreted language because, during execution, each line is interpreted to the machine language on-the-go.
#However, if we take the example of C++, the code needs to be compiled into an executable first, and then it can be executed. 
# In Python, we can skip this compilation step (Python does it for us behind the scenes) and directly run the code.
