# Agenda 
Go through the basics of Python to be able to start translating actions I want to system to do into code. 

## Basic programming condepts with Python 
1. Variables 
2. Data Types(&typecasting) conversion of one data type into another is typecasting/typeconversion in python.
    - Python supports a variety of functions or methods like int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict(), etc. 
3. Operators (+,-)
4. Logical operators 
5. If statements
6. Loops(for-while)
7. Functions
8. Scope of Variables
9. Python Modules

## For executions use one of the below tools 
1. IDE - visual studio code
2. IDE - Pycharm
3. Jupyter Notebook 
4. JupyterLab
5. Google collab 

## Leetcode
1. Two Sum 
26. Remove Duplicated from Sorted Array 
27. Remove Element 
217. Contains Duplicate 

## Python for Machine Learning

### Simple and consistent 
- Python's simplicity allows developer to write reliable systems. 
- Developers get to put all the effort into solving and ML problem instead of focussing on the technical nuances of the language. 
- Python was designed for readability. '
- It is easier to learn and use to develop modeles for machine learning. 
### Libraries and frameworks variety 
- 
### Independence across platforms 

### Great community and popularity
