#data sctructure - way of structuring data 
# structure data within the RAM ( RAM is where all the variable is going to be stored )
'''RAM is measured in bytes. Ex: 8 GB of RAM which is 8 billion bytes of space. 1 byte is 8 bits. 
bit is a position that can store a digit. These are always stored as 0 and 1. 
Individual bits can form bytes, which form RAM and they are used to store data structure'''

'''Every array value (NUMBER) is stored not in 8 bit spaces but in 32 bit spaces(which is 4 bytes to store (1 byte = 8 bit; 4 bytes = 32 bit)). 
31 0's and single one to reperesent '1' from the array [1,3,5]; 
Array has value and address. location of the data to be stored cannot be picked by the user but it is always continuous. 
Characters in an array are stored with 1 byte values per space. i., 8 bit . This is for ASCII characters
