# General philosophy (Borrowed) : 
    I read the book "Standing on the shoulders of Giants" while in my 1st year of undergrad and I definitely believe that we see the farthest while we see standing on the shoulders of giants. These notes and lots of anictodes throughtout the files are borrowed from those in the industry. 
    
    These are tools and ramdomly jotted down notes from hours scowering on the internet learning Python, ds and algos. Hope they help you too ! 
    PTS : Patter (common patterns), Templates (Use the template to avoid coding mistakes), Speedrun (Quickly read through problems) is a good pholosphy from Algo Moster ! 

    Some of the stuff used in everyday programming : Array, Stack, LinkedList
