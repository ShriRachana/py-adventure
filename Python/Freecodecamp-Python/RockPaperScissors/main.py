#variable called 'player_choice'
#assignment operator '='
#function is a set of code that only runs when it is called.
#create a function named get_choices()

def greeting():
    return 'hi'
'''greeting() is how we call the function and this function returns the string 'hi'. 
However just calling the function does not do anything with the value it returns
To print the value returned by the function, I create a variable called 'response'
Pass the value from 'greeting' into 'response' variable which is then printed.'
greeting()
