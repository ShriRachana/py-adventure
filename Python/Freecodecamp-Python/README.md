# Topic : Freecode camp - Python
This course is taught by Freecode camp to go over the basics of python. The video on youtube is 4 hours long. Howevber, to follow along and try every line of code from the video takes about 6-7 hours. This is an attempt at gathering the highlights of the video for review. Only review this if you have already tried and followed the video on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc).
### Section 1 : General instructions
