# Topic : Freecode camp - Python
This course is taught by Freecode camp to go over the basics of python. The video on youtube is 4 hours long. Howevber, to follow along and try every line of code from the video takes about 6-7 hours. This is an attempt at gathering the highlights of the video for review. Only review this if you have already tried and followed the video on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc).
### Section 1 : General instructions 
1. Install Python and execute 'hello earthlings' from you machine
2. Everything that is intended at the same level within a function , belong with the scope of the said function. 
3. Variables are containers used to store data.
4. Variable types do not need to be explicitly declared in python
5. Variables are dymanically assigned. 
6. Variable is created the moment you assign a value to it. 
7. Different data types suyppoted by Python : 
    Numbers: Integers (e.g., 42), floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14), complex numbers Â  
    Strings: Textual data (e.g., "Hello, world!")
    Booleans: True or False values
    Lists: Ordered collections of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3])
    Tuples: Immutable ordered collections (e.g., (1, 2, 3))
    Dictionaries: Unordered key-value pairs (e.g., {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30})
